# DED-Net-Defocus-Estimation-and-Deblurring
Code for our paper DED-Net: the Dual-task Network for Defocus Estimation and Deblurring

Overview
----
Different from the object motion blur or the camerashake blur, the situation of defocus blur varies greatly when the distance between the objects and the focal plane changed, which lead to different size of defocus spread. The level of defocus influence could be measure by the defocus estimation map. In this paper, we propose a network approach to estimate the defocus level in different part of the image, and use it to guide the deblurring task. To train the Defocus Estimation and Debluring Network (DED-Net), a light-field-camera generated single image defocus deblurring dataset, including the blurred images, the defocus estimations and the ground truth is proposed.Itâ€™s the first work which pays attention to the specific situation of blur caused by the defocus effect of cameras, and the results show that our method performs the state-of-the-art results on both the defocus estimation and the defocus deblurring tasks.
